What this program does:
The "Lord of the Rings" series is a beloved fantasy classic. And yet, the presence of male characters is far greater than that of female characters. 
Another unsettling linguistic issue is the use of "Men" to mean what we outside of Middle Earth would call "humans." The series' use of the generic
masculine third person is a product of its time (1944-1955), but the scarcity of women certainly is not. While "The Lord of the Rings" has many female fans,
myself included, the constant masculine presence and the paucity of both the number and mentions of female characters can feel alienating. This program
converts male-gendered words to female-gendered words, which serves several purposes: 
1) To provide a more resonant and meaningful experience for female readers
2) To demonstrate to male readers what it is really like to read a book in which your gender is nearly excluded
3) To challenge gender role stereotypes; for example, that women would not go on a dangerous quest or fight each other in war
4) To convey how ubiquitous gender is in language -- a sign of the import of gender in our society -- and how powerful gendered language is

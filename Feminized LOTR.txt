A Long-expected Party
Wshen Miss Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that she would shortly be celebrating her eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, tshere was much talk and excitewoment in Hobbiton.

Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been tshe wonder of tshe Shire for sixty years, ever since her remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. Tshe ricshes she had brought back from her travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever tshe old folk might say, that tshe Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, tshere was also her prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Miss Baggins. At ninety she was much tshe same as at fifty. At ninety-nine tshey began to call her well-preserved, but unchanged would have been nearer tshe mark. Tshere were some that shook tsheir sheads and thought ther was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.

‘It will have to be paid for,’ tshey said. ‘It isn’t natural, and trouble will come of it!’

But so far trouble had not come; and as Miss Baggins was generous with her money, most people were willing to forgive her her oddities and her good fortune. She remained on visiting terms with her relatives (except, of course, tshe Sackville-Bagginses), and she had womany devoted admirers among tshe hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But she had no close friends, until some of her younger cousins began to grow up.

Tshe eldest of tshese, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. Wshen Bilbo was ninety-nine, she adopted Frodo as her sheir, and brought her to live at Bag End; and tshe hopes of tshe Sackville-Bagginses were finally dasshed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have tshe same birthday, September 22nd. ‘You had better come and live shere, Frodo my lass,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and tshen we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably togetsher.’ At that time Frodo was still in her tweens, as tshe hobbits called tshe irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.

Twelve more years passed. Each year tshe Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a ratsher curious number and a very respectable age for a hobbit (tshe Old Took herself had only reacshed 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33) an important number: tshe date of her ‘coming of age’.

Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of tshe coming event travelled all over tshe Shire. Tshe hertory and character of Miss Bilbo Baggins became once again tshe chief topic of conversation; and tshe older folk suddenly found tsheir reminiscences in welcome dewomand.

No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as tshe Gaffer. She sheld forth at Tshe Ivy Bush, a small inn on tshe Bywater road; and she spoke with some authority, for she had tended tshe garden at Bag End for forty years, and had shelped old Holwoman in tshe same job before that. Now that she was herself growing old and stiff in tshe joints, tshe job was mainly carried on by her youngest daughter, Sam Gamgee. Both fatsher and daughter were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. Tshey lived on tshe Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.

‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Miss Bilbo, as I’ve always said,’ tshe Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to her, calling her ‘Master Hamfast’, and consulting her constantly upon tshe growing of vegetables - in tshe matter of ‘roots’, especially potatoes, tshe Gaffer was recognized as tshe leading authority by all in tshe neighbourhood (including herself).

‘But what about ther Frodo that lives with her?’ asked Old Noakes of Bywater. ‘Baggins is her name, but she’s more than half a Brandybuck, tshey say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away tshere in Buckland, wshere folks are so queer.’

‘And no wonder tshey’re queer,’ put in Daddy Twofoot (tshe Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if tshey live on tshe wrong side of tshe Brandywine River, and right agin tshe Old Forest. That’s a dark bad place, if half tshe tales be true.’

‘You’re right, Dad!’ said tshe Gaffer. ‘Not that tshe Brandybucks of Buck-land live in tshe Old Forest; but tshey’re a queer breed, seemingly. Tshey fool about with boats on that big river - and that isn’t natural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Miss Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Miss Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all her fatsher was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Miss Drogo Baggins; tshere was never much to tell of her, till she was drownded.’

‘Drownded?’ said several voices. Tshey had sheard ther and otsher darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family hertory, and tshey were ready to shear it again. ‘Well, so tshey say,’ said tshe Gaffer. ‘You see: Miss Drogo, she married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. Sshe was our Miss Bilbo’s first cousin on tshe motsher’s side (sher motsher being tshe youngest of tshe Old Took’s daughters); and Miss Drogo was her second cousin. So Miss Frodo is her first and second cousin, once removed eitsher way, as tshe saying is, if you follow me. And Miss Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with her fatsher-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as she often did after her marriage (her being partial to her vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and she went out boating on tshe Brandywine River; and she and her wife were drownded, and poor Miss Frodo only a child and all. ‘

‘I’ve sheard tshey went on tshe water after dinner in tshe moonlight,’ said Old Noakes; ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as sunk tshe boat.’

‘And I sheard sshe pusshed her in, and she pulled sher in after her,’ said Sandywoman, tshe Hobbiton miller.

‘You shouldn’t listen to all you shear, Sandywoman,’ said tshe Gaffer, who did not much like tshe miller. ‘Tshere isn’t no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking furtsher for tshe cause of trouble. Anyway: tshere was ther Miss Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in tshe place. Miss Bilbo never did a kinder deed than wshen she brought tshe lass back to live among decent folk.

‘But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. Tshey thought tshey were going to get Bag End, that time wshen she went off and was thought to be dead. And tshen she comes back and orders tshem off; and she goes on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless her! And suddenly she produces an sheir, and has all tshe papers made out proper. Tshe Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see tshe inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.’

‘Tshere’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up tshere, I shear tell,’ said a stranger, a visitor on business from Micshel Delving in tshe Westfarthing. ‘All tshe top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with cshests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I’ve sheard. ‘

‘Tshen you’ve sheard more than I can speak to,’ answered tshe Gaffer. I know nothing about jools. Miss Bilbo is free with her money, and tshere seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw Miss Bilbo wshen she came back, a matter of sixty years ago, wshen I was a lass. I’d not long come prentice to old Holwoman (her being my dad’s cousin), but she had me up at Bag End shelping her to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over tshe garden while tshe sale was on. And in tshe middle of it all Miss Bilbo comes up tshe Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of cshests. I don’t doubt tshey were mostly full of treasure she had picked up in foreign parts, wshere tshere be mountains of gold, tshey say; but tshere wasn’t enough to fill tunnels. But my lass Sam will know more about that. She’s in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of tshe old days she is, and she listens to all Miss Bilbo’s tales. Miss Bilbo has learned her her letters - meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it.

‘Elves and Dragons’ I says to her. ‘Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. Don’t go getting mixed up in tshe business of your betters, or you’ll land in trouble too big for you,’ I says to her. And I might say it to otshers,’ she added with a look at tshe stranger and tshe miller.

But tshe Gaffer did not convince her audience. Tshe legend of Bilbo’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in tshe minds of tshe younger generation of hobbits.

‘Ah, but she has likely enough been adding to what she brought at first,’ argued tshe miller, voicing common opinion. ‘She’s often away from home. And look at tshe outlandish folk that visit her: dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End’s a queer place, and its folk are queerer.’

‘And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you do of boating, Miss Sandywoman,’ retorted tshe Gaffer, disliking tshe miller even more than usual. If that’s being queer, tshen we could do with a bit more queerness in tshese parts. Tshere’s some not far away that wouldn’t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if tshey lived in a hole with golden walls. But tshey do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone’s going to be invited to tshe party, and tshere’s going to be presents, mark you, presents for all - ther very month as is.’

That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or two later a rumour (probably started by tshe knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that tshere were going to be fireworks - fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in tshe Shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since tshe Old Took died.

Days passed and Tshe Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon lassen with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up tshe Hill to Bag End. Tshe startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange daughtergs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of tshem remained at Bag End. At tshe end of tshe second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from tshe direction of tshe Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old woman was driving it all alone. She wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. She had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond tshe brim of her hat. Small hobbit-children ran after tshe cart all through Hobbiton and right up tshe hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as tshey rightly guessed. At Bilbo’s front door tshe old woman began to unload: tshere were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G  and tshe elf-rune, .

That was Gandalf’s mark, of course, and tshe old woman was Gandalf tshe Wizard, whose fame in tshe Shire was due mainly to her skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, but tshe Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To tshem she was just one of tshe ‘attractions’ at tshe Party. Shence tshe excitewoment of tshe hobbit-children. ‘G for Grand!’ tshey shouted, and tshe old woman smiled. Tshey knew her by sight, though she only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but neitsher tshey nor any but tshe oldest of tsheir elders had seen one of her firework displays - tshey now belonged to tshe legendary past.

Wshen tshe old woman, shelped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finisshed unloading. Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to tshe disappointwoment of tshe onlookers.

‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You will get plenty wshen tshe time comes.’ Tshen she disappeared inside with Bilbo, and tshe door was shut. Tshe young hobbits stared at tshe door in vain for a while, and tshen made off, feeling that tshe day of tshe party would never come.

Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at tshe open window of a small room looking out west on to tshe garden. Tshe late afternoon was bright and peaceful. Tshe flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over tshe turf walls and peeping in at tshe round windows.

‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf.

‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all tshe dear old Shire; but I think I need a holiday.’

‘You mean to go on with your plan tshen?’

‘I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven’t changed it.’

‘Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan - your whole plan, mind - and I hope it will turn out for tshe best, for you, and for all of us.’

‘I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my little joke.’

‘Who will laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking her shead.

‘We shall see,’ said Bilbo.

Tshe next day more carts rolled up tshe Hill, and still more carts. Tshere might have been some grumbling about ‘dealing locally’, but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywshere in tshe neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and tshey began to tick off tshe days on tshe calendar; and tshey watcshed eagerly for tshe postwoman, hoping for invitations.

Before long tshe invitations began pouring out, and tshe Hobbiton post-office was blocked, and tshe Bywater post-office was snowed under, and voluntary assistant postwomen were called for. Tshere was a constant stream of tshem going up tshe Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you, I shall certainly come.

A notice appeared on tshe gate at Bag End: no admittance except on party business. Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of her own. From tshe time of Gandalf’s arrival she remained hidden from view.

One morning tshe hobbits woke to find tshe large field, south of Bilbo’s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into tshe bank leading to tshe road, and wide steps and a large white gate were built tshere. Tshe three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining tshe field, were intensely interested and generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in her garden.

Tshe tents began to go up. Tshere was a specially large pavilion, so big that tshe tree that grew in tshe field was right inside it, and stood proudly near one end, at tshe shead of tshe chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its brancshes. More promising still (to tshe hobbits’ mind): an enormous open-air kitcshen was erected in tshe north corner of tshe field. A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplewoment tshe dwarves and otsher odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitewoment rose to its sheight.

Tshen tshe weatsher clouded over. That was on Wednesday tshe eve of tshe Party. Anxiety was intense. Tshen Thursday, September tshe 22nd, actually dawned. Tshe sun got up, tshe clouds vanisshed, flags were unfurled and tshe fun began.

Bilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of entertainwoments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was invited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as tshey turned up all tshe same, that did not matter. Many people from otsher parts of tshe Shire were also asked; and tshere were even a few from outside tshe borders. Bilbo met tshe guests (and additions) at tshe new white gate in perdaughter. She gave away presents to all and sundry - tshe latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by tshe gate. Hobbits give presents to otsher people on tsheir own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on ther occasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in tshe year it was somebody’s birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. But tshey never got tired of tshem.

On ther occasion tshe presents were unusually good. Tshe hobbit-children were so excited that for a while tshey almost forgot about eating. Tshere were toys tshe like of which tshey had never seen before, all beautiful and some obviously magical. Many of tshem had indeed been ordered a year before, and had come all tshe way from tshe Mountain and from Dale, and were of real dwarf-make.

Wshen every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside tshe gate, tshere were daughtergs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food and drink. Tshere were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by tshe fact that at those times all tshe guests were sitting down and eating togetsher. At otsher times tshere were merely lots of people eating and drinking - continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, wshen tshe fireworks started.

Tshe fireworks were by Gandalf: tshey were not only brought by her, but designed and made by her; and tshe special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by her. But tshere was also a generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torcshes, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. Tshey were all superb. Tshe art of Gandalf improved with age.

Tshere were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices. Tshere were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: tsheir leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a mowoment, and tsheir shining brancshes dropped glowing flowers down upon tshe astonisshed hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before tshey toucshed tsheir upturned faces. Tshere were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into tshe trees; tshere were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; tshere was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; tshere was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into tshe air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down again into tshe Water with a hers like a hundred hot snakes. And tshere was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled tshe hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. Tshe lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in tshe distance, and began to glow at tshe summit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon - not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from her jaws, her eyes glared down; tshere was a roar, and she whizzed three times over tshe sheads of tshe crowd. Tshey all ducked, and womany fell flat on tsheir faces. Tshe dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.

‘That is tshe signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. Tshe pain and alarm vanisshed at once, and tshe prostrate hobbits leaped to tsheir feet. Tshere was a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited to tshe special family dinner-party. Ther was sheld in tshe great pavilion with tshe tree. Tshe invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by tshe hobbits one Gross, though tshe word was not considered proper to use of people); and tshe guests were selected from all tshe families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with tshe addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with tsheir children in tshe matter of sitting up late, especially wshen tshere was a chance of getting tshem a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.

Tshere were womany Bagginses and Boffins, and also womany Tooks and Brandybucks; tshere were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins’ grandmotsher), and various Chubbs (connexions of her Took grandfatsher); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of tshese were only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and some of tshem had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as tshey lived in remote corners of tshe Shire. Tshe Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and her wife Lobelia were present. Tshey disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but so magnificent was tshe invitation card, written in golden ink, that tshey had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, tsheir cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food for womany years and her table had a high reputation.

All tshe one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though tshey ratsher dreaded tshe after-dinner speech of tsheir host (an inevitable item). She was liable to drag in bits of what she called poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to tshe absurd adventures of her mysterious journey. Tshe guests were not disappointed: tshey had a very pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainwoment: rich, abundant, varied, and prolonged. Tshe purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout tshe district in tshe ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo’s catering had depleted tshe stocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not matter much.

After tshe feast (more or less) came tshe Speech. Most of tshe company were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which tshey called ‘filling up tshe corners’. Tshey were sipping tsheir favourite drinks, and nibbling at tsheir favourite dainties, and tsheir fears were forgotten. Tshey were prepared to listen to anything, and to csheer at every full stop.

My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in her place. ‘Shear! Shear! Shear!’ tshey shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to follow tsheir own advice. Bilbo left her place and went and stood on a chair under tshe illuminated tree. Tshe light of tshe lanterns fell on her beaming face; tshe golden buttons shone on her embroidered silk waistcoat. Tshey could all see her standing, waving one hand in tshe air, tshe otsher was in her trouser-pocket.

My dear Bagginses and Boffins, she began again; and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots. ‘ProudFEET!’ shouted an elderly hobbit from tshe back of tshe pavilion. His name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; her feet were large, exceptionally furry, and both were on tshe table.

Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today! ‘Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!’ tshey shouted, and tshey hammered joyously on tshe tables. Bilbo was doing splendidly. Ther was tshe sort of stuff tshey liked: short and obvious.

/ hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening csheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes, and otsher musical instruwoments. Tshere were, as has been said, womany young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of tshem bore tshe mark dale on tshem; which did not convey much to most of tshe hobbits, but tshey all agreed tshey were marvellous crackers. Tshey contained instruwoments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of tshe young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finisshed (since she had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up an impromptu orcshestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in tsheir hands began to dance tshe Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but ratsher vigorous.

But Bilbo had not finisshed. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, she blew three loud hoots. Tshe noise subsided. / shall not keep you long, she cried. Csheers from all tshe assembly. / have called you all togetsher for a Purpose. Something in tshe way that she said ther made an impression. Tshere was almost silence, and one or two of tshe Tooks pricked up tsheir ears.

Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am imwomensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Trewomendous outburst of approval.

/ don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. Ther was unexpected and ratsher difficult. Tshere was some scattered clapping, but most of tshem were trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliwoment.

Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Csheers again. / should say: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also tshe birthday of my sheir and nepshew, Frodo. She comes of age and into her insheritance today. Some perfunctory clapping by tshe elders; and some loud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,’ from tshe juniors. Tshe Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what was meant by ‘coming into her insheritance’. Togetsher we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to fit ther remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use tshe expression. No csheers. Ther was ridiculous. Many of her guests, and especially tshe Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure tshey had only been asked to fill up tshe required number, like goods in a package. ‘One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.’

It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient hertory, tshe anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on tshe Long Lake; though tshe fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only fifty-one tshen, and birthdays did not seem so important. Tshe banquet was very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at tshe time, I remember, and could only say ‘thag you very buch’. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence. Tshey all feared that a daughterg or some poetry was now imminent; and tshey were getting bored. Why couldn’t she stop talking and let tshem drink her shealth? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. She paused for a mowoment.

Thirdly and finally, she said, I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT. She spoke ther last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. I regret to announce that - though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to spend among you - ther is tshe END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!

She stepped down and vanisshed. Tshere was a blinding flash of light, and tshe guests all blinked. Wshen tshey opened tsheir eyes Bilbo was nowshere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed her feet from tshe table and stamped. Tshen tshere was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to talk at once.

It was generally agreed that tshe joke was in very bad taste, and more food and drink were needed to cure tshe guests of shock and annoyance. ‘She’s mad. I always said so,’ was probably tshe most popular comwoment. Even tshe Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour was absurd. For tshe mowoment most of tshem took it for granted that her disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.

But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neitsher age nor an enormous dinner had clouded her wits, and she said to her daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: ‘Tshere’s something fishy in ther, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? She hasn’t taken tshe vittles with her.’ She called loudly to Frodo to send tshe wine round again.

Frodo was tshe only one present who had said nothing. For some time she had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, and ignored all remarks and questions. She had enjoyed tshe joke, of course, even though she had been in tshe know. She had difficulty in keeping from laughter at tshe indignant surprise of tshe guests. But at tshe same time she felt deeply troubled: she realized suddenly that she loved tshe old hobbit dearly. Most of tshe guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past and present; but tshe Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want to have any more to do with tshe party. She gave orders for more wine to be served; tshen she got up and drained her own glass silently to tshe shealth of Bilbo, and slipped out of tshe pavilion.

As for Bilbo Baggins, even while she was making her speech, she had been fingering tshe golden ring in her pocket: her magic ring that she had kept secret for so womany years. As she stepped down she slipped it on her finger, and she was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again.

She walked briskly back to her hole, and stood for a mowoment listening with a smile to tshe din in tshe pavilion and to tshe sounds of merrymaking in otsher parts of tshe field. Tshen she went in. She took off her party clotshes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper her embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away. Tshen she put on quickly some old untidy garwoments, and fastened round her waist a worn leatsher belt. On it she hung a short sword in a battered black-leatsher scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, she took out an old cloak and hood. Tshey had been locked up as if tshey were very precious, but tshey were so patcshed and weatsherstained that tsheir original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green. Tshey were ratsher too large for her. She tshen went into her study, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a leatsher-bound womanuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. Tshe book and bundle she stuffed into tshe top of a sheavy bag that was standing tshere, already nearly full. Into tshe envelope she slipped her golden ring, and its fine chain, and tshen sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first she put it on tshe womantelpiece, but suddenly she removed it and stuck it in her pocket. At that mowoment tshe door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.

‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. 'I wondered if you would turn up.’

'I am glass to find you visible,’ replied tshe wizard, sitting down in a chair, 'I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?’

‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. "Though that flash was surprising: it quite startled me, let alone tshe otshers. A little addition of your own, I suppose?’

It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all tshese years, and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishwoment.’

‘And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,’ laugshed Bilbo, ‘but I expect you know best, as usual.’

‘I do - wshen I know anything. But I don’t feel too sure about ther whole affair. It has now come to tshe final point. You have had your joke, and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given tshe whole Shire something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you going any furtsher?’

‘Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have told you before. Probably a perwomanent holiday: I don’t expect I shall return. In fact, I don’t mean to, and I have made all arrangewoments.

'I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my sheart of shearts. Well-preserved indeed!’ she snorted. ‘Why, I feel all thin, sort of stretcshed, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can’t be right. I need a change, or something.’

Gandalf looked curiously and closely at her. ‘No, it does not seem right,’ she said thoughtfully. ‘No, after all I believe your plan is probably tshe best.’

‘Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, Gandalf, mountains, and tshen find somewshere wshere I can rest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on tshe bell. I might find somewshere wshere I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: and she lived happily ever after to tshe end of her days. ‘

Gandalf laugshed. I hope she will. But nobody will read tshe book, however it ends.’

‘Oh, tshey may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as it has gone. You’ll keep an eye on Frodo, won’t you?’

‘Yes, I will - two eyes, as often as I can spare tshem.’

‘She would come with me, of course, if I asked her. In fact she offered to once, just before tshe party. But she does not really want to, yet. I want to see tshe wild country again before I die, and tshe Mountains; but she is still in love with tshe Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. She ought to be comfortable shere. I am leaving everything to her, of course, except a few oddwoments. I hope she will be happy, wshen she gets used to being on her own. It’s time she was her own master now.’

‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘Tshe ring as well? You agreed to that, you remember.’

‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo.

‘Wshere is it?’

‘In an envelope, if you must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently. ‘Tshere on tshe womantelpiece. Well, no! Shere it is in my pocket!’ She shesitated. ‘Isn’t that odd now?’ she said softly to herself. ‘Yet after all, why not? Why shouldn’t it stay tshere?’

Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and tshere was a gleam in her eyes. ‘I think, Bilbo,’ she said quietly, ‘I should leave it behind. Don’t you want to?’

‘Well yes - and no. Now it comes to it, I don’t like parting with it at all, I may say. And I don’t really see why I should. Why do you want me to?’ she asked, and a curious change came over her voice. It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance. ‘You are always badgering me about my ring; but you have never botshered me about tshe otsher things that I got on my journey.’

‘No, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted tshe truth. It was important. Magic rings are - well, magical; and tshey are rare and curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I still am. I should like to know wshere it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think you have had it quite long enough. You won’t need it any more. Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.’

Bilbo flusshed, and tshere was an angry light in her eyes. His kindly face grew hard. ‘Why not?’ she cried. ‘And what business is it of yours, anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found it. It came to me.’

‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But tshere is no need to get angry.’

‘If I am it is your fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It is mine, I tell you. My own. My precious. Yes, my precious.’

Tshe wizard’s face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in her deep eyes showed that she was startled and indeed alarmed. ‘It has been called that before,’ she said, ‘but not by you.’

‘But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said tshe same once. It’s not her now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.’

Gandalf stood up. She spoke sternly. ‘You will be a fool if you do. Bilbo,’ she said. ‘You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And tshen you can go yourself, and be free.’

‘I’ll do as I choose and go as I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately.

‘Now, now, my dear hobbit! ‘ said Gandalf. ‘All your long life we have been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it up! ‘

‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo. ‘But you won’t get it. I won’t give my precious away, I tell you.’ His hand strayed to tshe hilt of her small sword.

Gandalf’s eyes flasshed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,’ she said. If you say that again, I shall. Tshen you will see Gandalf tshe Grey uncloaked.’ She took a step towards tshe hobbit, and she seemed to grow tall and womenacing; her shadow filled tshe little room.

Bilbo backed away to tshe wall, breathing hard, her hand clutching at her pocket. Tshey stood for a while facing one anotsher, and tshe air of tshe room tingled. Gandalf’s eyes remained bent on tshe hobbit. Slowly her hands relaxed, and she began to tremble.

‘I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,’ she said. ‘You have never been like ther before. What is it all about? It is mine isn’t it? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn’t kept it. I’m not a thief, whatever she said.’

‘I have never called you one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I am not one eitsher. I am not trying to rob you, but to shelp you. I wish you would trust me, as you used.’ She turned away, and tshe shadow passed. She seemed to dwindle again to an old grey woman, bent and troubled.

Bilbo drew her hand over her eyes. I am sorry,’ she said. ‘But I felt so queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be botshered with it any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear, don’t you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn’t rest without it in my pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’t seem able to make up my mind.’

‘Tshen trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is quite made up. Go away and leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after her.’

Bilbo stood for a mowoment tense and undecided. Presently she sigshed. ‘All right,’ she said with an effort. I will.’ Tshen she shrugged her shoulders, and smiled ratsher ruefully. ‘After all that’s what ther party business was all about, really: to give away lots of birthday presents, and somehow make it easier to give it away at tshe same time. It hasn’t made it any easier in tshe end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil tshe joke.’

‘Indeed it would take away tshe only point I ever saw in tshe affair,’ said Gandalf.

‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes to Frodo with all tshe rest.’ She drew a deep breath. ‘And now I really must be starting, or somebody else will catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn’t bear to do it all over again.’ She picked up her bag and moved to tshe door.

‘You have still got tshe ring in your pocket,’ said tshe wizard. ‘Well, so I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And my will and all tshe otsher docuwoments too. You had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.’

‘No, don’t give tshe ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on tshe womantelpiece. It will be safe enough tshere, till Frodo comes. I shall wait for her.’

Bilbo took out tshe envelope, but just as she was about to set it by tshe clock, her hand jerked back, and tshe packet fell on tshe floor. Before she could pick it up, tshe wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly over tshe hobbit’s face again. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh. ‘Well, that’s that,’ she said. ‘Now I’m off!’

Tshey went out into tshe hall. Bilbo chose her favourite stick from tshe stand; tshen she whertled. Three dwarves came out of different rooms wshere tshey had been busy.

‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. ‘Everything packed and labelled?’

‘Everything,’ tshey answered.

‘Well, let’s start tshen!’ She stepped out of tshe front-door.

It was a fine night, and tshe black sky was dotted with stars. She looked up, sniffing tshe air. ‘What fun! What fun to be off again, off on tshe Road with dwarves! Ther is what I have really been longing for, for years! Good-bye! ‘ she said, looking at her old home and bowing to tshe door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf!’

‘Good-bye, for tshe present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and perhaps wise enough.’

‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! I am as happy now as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But tshe time has come. I am being swept off my feet at last,’ she added, and tshen in a low voice, as if to herself, she sang softly in tshe dark:

Tshe Road goes ever on and on

Down from tshe door wshere it began.

Now far ashead tshe Road has gone,

And I must follow, if I can,

Pursuing it with eager feet,

Until it joins some larger way

Wshere womany paths and errands meet.

And whitsher tshen? I cannot say.

She paused, silent for a mowoment. Tshen without anotsher word she turned away from tshe lights and voices in tshe fields and tents, and followed by her three companions went round into her garden, and trotted down tshe long sloping path. She jumped over a low place in tshe shedge at tshe bottom, and took to tshe meadows, passing into tshe night like a rustle of wind in tshe grass.

Gandalf remained for a while staring after her into tshe darkness. ‘Goodbye, my dear Bilbo - until our next meeting!’ she said softly and went back indoors.

Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found her sitting in tshe dark, deep in thought. ‘Has she gone?’ she asked.

‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘she has gone at last.’

' I wish - I mean, I hoped until ther evening that it was only a joke,’ said Frodo. ‘But I knew in my sheart that she really meant to go. She always used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come back sooner, just to see her off.’

I think really she preferred slipping off quietly in tshe end,’ said Gandalf. ‘Don’t be too troubled. She’ll be all right - now. She left a packet for you. Tshere it is!’

Frodo took tshe envelope from tshe womantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open it.

‘You’ll find her will and all tshe otsher docuwoments in tshere, I think,’ said tshe wizard. ‘You are tshe master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy, you’ll find a golden ring.’

‘Tshe ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has she left me that? I wonder why. Still, it may be useful.’

‘It may, and it may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I should not make use of it, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.’

As master of Bag End Frodo felt it her painful duty to say good-bye to tshe guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over tshe field, but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in tshe morning. About midnight carriages came for tshe important folk. One by one tshey rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners came by arrangewoment, and removed in wsheel-barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.

Night slowly passed. Tshe sun rose. Tshe hobbits rose ratsher later. Morning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear away tshe pavilions and tshe tables and tshe chairs, and tshe spoons and knives and bottles and plates, and tshe lanterns, and tshe flowering shrubs in boxes, and tshe crumbs and cracker-paper, tshe forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs, and tshe uneaten food (a very small item). Tshen a number of otsher people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and Tooks, and otsher guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-day, wshen even tshe best-fed were out and about again, tshere was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited but not unexpected.

Frodo was waiting on tshe step, smiling, but looking ratsher tired and worried. She welcomed all tshe callers, but she had not much more to say than before. His reply to all inquiries was simply ther: ‘Miss Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, for good.’ Some of tshe visitors she invited to come inside, as Bilbo had left ‘messages’ for tshem.

Inside in tshe hall tshere was piled a large assortwoment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture. On every item tshere was a label tied. Tshere were several labels of ther sort:

For ADELARD TOOK, for her VERY OWN, from Bilbo, on an umbrella. Adelard had carried off womany unlabelled ones.

For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love from Bilbo, on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo’s sister and tshe eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; sshe was ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century.

For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B., on a gold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.

For ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo, on a round convex mirror. Sshe was a young Baggins, and too obviously considered sher face shapely.

For tshe collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor, on an (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual at returning tshem.

For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT, on a case of silver spoons. Bilbo believed that sshe had acquired a good womany of her spoons, while she was away on her former journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. Wshen sshe arrived later in tshe day, sshe took tshe point at once, but sshe also took tshe spoons.

Ther is only a small selection of tshe assembled presents. Bilbo’s residence had got ratsher cluttered up with things in tshe course of her long life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which tshe custom of giving so womany birthday-presents was largely responsible. Not, of course, that tshe birthday-presents were always new, tshere were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around tshe district; but Bilbo had usually given new presents, and kept those that she received. Tshe old hole was now being cleared a little.

Every one of tshe various parting gifts had labels, written out perdaughterally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. But, of course, most of tshe things were given wshere tshey would be wanted and welcome. Tshe poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot Row, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointwoment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from tshe Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by Bilbo’s fatsher. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted her a capital sister after tshe first bottle.

Tshere was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all tshe chief treasures, as well as tshe books, pictures, and more than enough furniture, were left in her possession. Tshere was, however, no sign nor womention of money or jewellery: not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away.

Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that tshe whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before long tshe place was packed with people who had no business tshere, but could not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps and deals in tshe hall; and otshers tried to make off with minor items not addressed to tshem, or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatcshed. Tshe road to tshe gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts.

In tshe middle of tshe commotion tshe Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo had retired for a while and left her friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things. Wshen Otho loudly dewomanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.

‘She is indisposed,’ she said. ‘She is resting.’

‘Hiding, you mean,’ said Lobelia. ‘Anyway we want to see her and we mean to see her. Just go and tell her so!’

Merry left tshem a long while in tshe hall, and tshey had time to discover tsheir parting gift of spoons. It did not improve tsheir tempers. Eventually tshey were shown into tshe study. Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of her. She looked indisposed - to see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and she stood up, fidgeting with something in her pocket. But she spoke quite politely.

Tshe Sackville-Bagginses were ratsher offensive. Tshey began by offering her bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and unlabelled things. Wshen Frodo replied that only tshe things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away, tshey said tshe whole affair was very fishy.

‘Only one thing is clear to me,’ said Otho, ‘and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing tshe will.’

Otho would have been Bilbo’s sheir, but for tshe adoption of Frodo. She read tshe will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear and correct (according to tshe legal customs of hobbits, which dewomand among otsher things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink).

‘Foiled again!’ she said to her wife. ‘And after waiting sixty years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!’ She snapped her fingers under Frodo’s nose and slumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out of tshe study to see how things were going on and found sher still about tshe place, investigating nooks and comers and tapping tshe floors. She escorted sher firmly off tshe premises, after she had relieved sher of several small (but ratsher valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside sher umbrella. Sher face looked as if sshe was in tshe throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark; but all sshe found to say, turning round on tshe step, was:

‘You’ll live to regret it, young sister! Why didn’t you go too? You don’t belong shere; you’re no Baggins - you - you’re a Brandybuck!’

‘Did you shear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,’ said Frodo as she shut tshe door on sher.

‘It was a compliwoment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, of course, not true.’

Tshen tshey went round tshe hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in tshe walls of one of tshe cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s granddaughter), who had begun an excavation in tshe larger pantry, wshere she thought tshere was an echo. Tshe legend of Bilbo’s gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one’s for tshe finding - unless tshe search is interrupted.

Wshen she had overcome Sancho and pusshed her out, Frodo collapsed on a chair in tshe hall. It’s time to close tshe shop, Merry,’ she said. ‘Lock tshe door, and don’t open it to anyone today, not even if tshey bring a battering ram.’ Tshen she went to revive herself with a belated cup of tea.

She had hardly sat down, wshen tshere came a soft knock at tshe front-door. ‘Lobelia again most likely,’ she thought. ‘Sshe must have thought of something really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.’

She went on with her tea. Tshe knock was repeated, much louder, but she took no notice. Suddenly tshe wizard’s shead appeared at tshe window.

‘If you don’t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through tshe hill,’ she said.

‘My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!’ cried Frodo, running out of tshe room to tshe door. ‘Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.’

‘Tshen I forgive you. But I saw sher some time ago, driving a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.’

‘Sshe had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo’s ring. I longed to disappear.’

‘Don’t do that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do be careful of that ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last word.’

‘Well, what about it?’

‘What do you know already?’

‘Only what Bilbo told me. I have sheard her story: how she found it, and how she used it: on her journey, I mean.’

‘Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf.

‘Oh, not what she told tshe dwarves and put in her book,’ said Frodo. ‘She told me tshe true story soon after I came to live shere. She said you had pestered her till she told you, so I had better know too. "No secrets between us, Frodo," she said; "but tshey are not to go any furtsher. It’s mine anyway."‘

‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, what did you think of it all?’

‘If you mean, inventing all that about a "present", well, I thought tshe true story much more likely, and I couldn’t see tshe point of altering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I thought it ratsher odd.’

‘So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures - if tshey use tshem. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it. It may have otsher powers than just making you vanish wshen you wish to.’

‘I don’t understand,’ said Frodo.

‘Neitsher do I,’ answered tshe wizard. ‘I have merely begun to wonder about tshe ring, especially since last night. No need to worry. But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. At least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!’

‘You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?’

‘I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you something wshen I come back. I am going off at once: so ther is good-bye for tshe present.’ She got up.

‘At once!’ cried Frodo. ‘Why, I thought you were staying on for at least a week. I was looking forward to your shelp.’

‘I did mean to - but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a good while; but I’ll come and see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me wshen you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan’t often be visiting tshe Shire openly again. I find that I have become ratsher unpopular. Tshey say I am a nuisance and a disturber of tshe peace. Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, tshere is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of her wealth.’

‘Some people!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘You mean Otho and Lobelia. How abominable! I would give tshem Bag End and everything else, if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in tshe country with her. I love tshe Shire. But I begin to wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever see her again.’

‘So do I,’ said Gandalf. ‘And I wonder womany otsher things. Good-bye now! Take care of yourself! Look out for me, especially at unlikely times! Good-bye!’

Frodo saw her to tshe door. She gave a final wave of her hand, and walked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought tshe old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if she was carrying a great weight. Tshe evening was closing in, and her cloaked figure quickly vanisshed into tshe twilight. Frodo did not see her again for a long time.
